For this case study we assume that our audience is the CEO and CFO of Budweiser (our client) and that they only have had one class in statistics. They have hired us to answer 7 questions and beyond those general questions we will speculate / anticipate what may be of interest to them.

We will start by importing the following data for analysis:

Beers.csv:
Name: Name of the beer.
Beer_ID: Unique identifier of the beer.
ABV: Alcohol by volume of the beer.
IBU: International Bitterness Units of the beer.
Brewery_ID: Brewery id associated with the beer.
Style: Style of the beer.
Ounces: Ounces of beer.

Breweries.csv:
Brew_ID: Unique identifier of the brewery.
Name: Name of the brewery.
City: City where the brewery is located.
State: U.S. State where the brewery is located.

Load Theme for plots

```{r}
theme_set(theme_fivethirtyeight())
theme_update(axis.title = element_text()) #the default for fivethirtyeight is to not show axis labels, this removes that default so we can choose to specify and display axis titles
```

Load and Merge initial data sets provided

```{r}
beers = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickfontenot/DS6306_Study1/main/Beers.csv", header = TRUE)

breweries = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickfontenot/DS6306_Study1/main/Breweries.csv", header = TRUE)

dim(beers) #2410 observations x 7 columns
dim(breweries) #558 observations x 4 columns

sum(is.na(beers$Brewery_id)) #there are no missing values on the merge var
sum(is.na(breweries$Brew_ID)) #there are no missing values on the merge var

beers <- beers %>% rename(Beer_Name = Name) #both dataframes have "Name"
breweries <- breweries %>% rename(Brewery_Name = Name)
view(beers)
beerbrew <- merge(beers,breweries, by.x = "Brewery_id", by.y = "Brew_ID")
head(beerbrew)
```

Add Features to the individual beer level data frame

```{r}
style <- beerbrew %>% count(Class)
view(style)

#There are 100 styles of craft beer, group them into broader classes for analysis by class

beerbrew["Class"] <- ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"IPA"),"IPA", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Ale"),"Ale", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Lager"),"Lager", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Stout"),"Stout", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Pilsner"),"Pilsner", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Pilsener"),"Pilsner", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Porter"),"Porter", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"APA"),"APA", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Cider"),"Cider", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Witbier"),"Witbier", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Kölsch"),"Kölsch", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Fruit"),"Fruit", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Hefeweizen"),"Hefeweizen", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Oktoberfest"),"Oktoberfest", ifelse(str_detect(beerbrew$Style,"Bitter"),"Bitter",
"Other")))))))))))))))

beerbrew %>%ggplot(aes(x = Class)) + geom_bar() +
ggtitle("Distribution of Beer Classes") + coord_flip() + xlab("Class") + ylab("Count")

```

Investigate NA values to determine what needs resolution

```{r}
aggr_plot <- aggr(beerbrew, col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(beerbrew), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Percent data missing","Combinations Missing"))

marginplot(beerbrew[c(4,5)])
view(beerbrew)
#IBU values are missing for 42% of the beers and needs resolution, only 2.6% of beers are missing ABV, and all other variables are clean with no missing values
```
Method #1 for imputing NA values, with Predictive Mean Mean Matching

```{r}
tempData <- mice(beerbrew,m=5,maxit=50,meth='pmm',seed=500)
xyplot(tempData,ABV ~ IBU,pch=18,cex=1)
densityplot(tempData)

beerbrew_imputed <- complete(tempData,1)
head(beerbrew_imputed)

md.pattern(beerbrew_imputed)

aggr_plot <- aggr(beerbrew_imputed, col=c('navyblue','red'), numbers=TRUE, sortVars=TRUE, labels=names(beerbrew_imputed), cex.axis=.7, gap=3, ylab=c("Histogram of missing data","Pattern"))

#Merge imputed value columns into main data frame
colnames(beerbrew_imputed)[4] = "ABV.pmm.imputed" 
colnames(beerbrew_imputed)[5] = "IBU.pmm.imputed" 

temp <- beerbrew_imputed %>% select(Beer_ID, ABV.pmm.imputed, IBU.pmm.imputed)

beerbrew <- left_join(beerbrew, temp,by = "Beer_ID")

beerbrew
```
Method #2 for imputing values: Study distributions of IBU and ABV by Class of beer rather than using predictive mean for distribution of all beer style combined

```{r}
beerbrew %>% ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = IBU)) + 
geom_boxplot() + 
ggtitle("Boxplot of IBU by Beer Class") + 
xlab("Class") + ylab("IBU") + coord_flip()

beerbrew %>% ggplot(aes(x = Class, y = ABV)) + 
geom_boxplot() + 
ggtitle("Boxplot of ABV by Beer Class") + 
xlab("Class") + ylab("ABV") + coord_flip()

#Instead of imputation method pmm, replace na with the mean IBU and ABV for the Class of beer it belongs too

impute.mean <- function(x) replace(x, is.na(x), mean(x, na.rm = TRUE))

beerbrew <- beerbrew %>% group_by(Class) %>%
    mutate(
        IBU.class.imputed = impute.mean(IBU),
        ABV.class.imputed = impute.mean(ABV)  
    )

beerbrew %>% ggplot(aes(x = IBU.pmm.imputed, y = IBU.class.imputed)) + 
geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
ggtitle("IBU Imputed PMM vs. Class Mean methods") + 
xlab("IBU (PMM imputed)") + ylab("IBU (Class Mean imputed")

beerbrew %>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV.pmm.imputed, y = ABV.class.imputed)) + 
geom_point(position = "jitter") + 
ggtitle("ABV Imputed PMM vs. Class Mean methods") + 
xlab("ABV (PMM imputed)") + ylab("ABV (Class Mean imputed")

```

Create State Level table of summary statistics

```{r}
StateData = breweries %>% count(State) #count up the breweries in each state.

Original <- setNames(aggregate(cbind(IBU,ABV)~State, beerbrew, median,na.action = na.omit), c("State","IBU.median","ABV.median"))

PMM <- setNames(aggregate(cbind(IBU.pmm.imputed,ABV.pmm.imputed)~State, beerbrew, median,na.action = na.omit), c("State","IBU.pmm.median","ABV.pmm.median"))

Class <- setNames(aggregate(cbind(IBU.class.imputed,ABV.class.imputed)~State, beerbrew, median,na.action = na.omit), c("State","IBU.class.median","ABV.class.median"))

StateData <- merge(merge(Original,PMM,all=T),Class,all=T)

Brewery.count = breweries %>% count(State) #count up the breweries in each state.

Brewery.count <- Brewery.count %>% rename(Breweries = n)

StateData <- merge(StateData,Brewery.count)

view(StateData)
```

Add external data and features to the State level tables including, consumption, population, and consumption per capita

```{r}
#load beer consumption per capita data
per.capita <-  read.csv("https://github.com/rickfontenot/DS6306_Study1/raw/main/NIH_per_capita.csv", header = TRUE)

#load census population data
census2019 <-  read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rickfontenot/DS6306_Study1/main/nst-est2019.csv", header = TRUE)

#rename columns of interest and remove all others
census2019 <- census2019 %>% rename('State' = 1)
census2019 <- census2019 %>% rename("pop.2019" = "X.11")
census2019 <- subset(census2019, select = c("State", "pop.2019"))

#remove header rows and regions other than states
census2019 <- census2019[-c(1,2,3), ]
census2019 <- census2019[-c(1:5, 57:63), ]

#remove leading dots to properly format State labels
census2019$State <- str_replace_all(census2019$State, "^\\.", "")

#Merge Consumption and population data
consumption_pop <- merge(per.capita,census2019)

#Add state abbreviations to merge with State Data Frame
lookup = data.frame(abb = state.abb, State = state.name) #makes a data frame with State name and abbreviation.
lookup$abb <- trimws(lookup$abb)

#Add District of Columbia
lookup <- lookup %>% add_row(abb= "DC", State ="District of Columbia")

temp <- merge(consumption_pop,lookup)

#Rename State to "abb" and trim for merge
colnames(StateData)[1] = "abb"
StateData$abb <- trimws(StateData$abb)

StateData <- merge(StateData,temp, all=T)
view(StateData)
```

Create a State Mapping data frame so that all summary statistics can be geographically plotted

```{r}
states <- map_data("state")
colnames(states)[5] = "State"

StateData$State <- tolower(StateData$State)
view(StateData)

StateMapData <- merge(states,StateData, by="State", all.x=T)
StateMapData <- StateMapData[order(StateMapData$order),]
```

Question 1: How many breweries are present in each state?

```{r}
#bar chart ordered by rank of most breweries
StateData %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(abb, -Breweries), y=Breweries)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust = 0.5),axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,size =   rel(.6),margin = margin(.05, unit = "cm"),vjust =0)) + 
  labs(title = "Number of Breweries by State", y = "Number of Breweries",x= 'State')

#geographical heat map of same data
ggplot(StateMapData, aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=Breweries))+
  geom_path()+ 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90")+ggtitle("Number of Breweries by State")+
  theme(axis.title.x=element_blank(), axis.text.x=element_blank(), axis.ticks.x=element_blank()) + theme(axis.title.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank(), axis.ticks.y=element_blank()) + theme(axis.line = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(), panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), panel.border = element_blank(), panel.background = element_blank()) +coord_map()

```

Question 2: Merge beer data with the breweries data. Print the first 6 observations and the last six observations to check the merged file.  (RMD only, this does not need to be included in the presentation or the deck.)

```{r}
#merge completed above, here we will print the first/last 6 obervations

head(beerbrew,6)
tail(beerbrew,6)

```

Question 3: Address the missing values in each column.See above for imputing using two methods. Here we will compare methods and decide which is best to use for subsequent analyses


```{r}
#stacked histogram comparing imputation methods, transform wide to long first
imputed.IBU <- beerbrew %>% select(Beer_ID,Class,IBU,IBU.pmm.imputed,IBU.class.imputed)
colnames(imputed.IBU)[3] = "Original"
colnames(imputed.IBU)[4] = "PMM"
colnames(imputed.IBU)[5] = "Class-mean"

imputed.IBU <- imputed.IBU %>% pivot_longer(c(Original, PMM, `Class-mean`), names_to = "Method", values_to = "IBU")

imputed.IBU %>% ggplot(aes(x = IBU, fill=Method)) + geom_histogram() +
ggtitle("IBU by Imputation Method") + xlab("IBU") + ylab("Count") +facet_wrap(~Method,ncol=1)

imputed.ABV <- beerbrew %>% select(Beer_ID,Class,ABV,ABV.pmm.imputed,ABV.class.imputed)
colnames(imputed.ABV)[3] = "Original"
colnames(imputed.ABV)[4] = "PMM"
colnames(imputed.ABV)[5] = "Class-mean"

imputed.ABV <- imputed.ABV %>% pivot_longer(c(Original, PMM, `Class-mean`), names_to = "Method", values_to = "ABV")

imputed.ABV %>% ggplot(aes(x = ABV, fill=Method)) + geom_histogram() +
ggtitle("ABV by Imputation Method") + xlab("ABV") + ylab("Count") +facet_wrap(~Method,ncol=1)

#IBU vs. ABV relationship by Imputation method

imputed <- merge(imputed.IBU,imputed.ABV,all=T)


imputed %>% ggplot(mapping=aes(y=IBU, x=ABV,color=Method)) + geom_point(size=0.5, position=position_jitter(width = 0.001, height = 1))+ geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE,size=1)+ labs(title="Correlation between ABV and IBU")
```

Question 4: Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

```{r}
#use Class Mean imputed values for medians
StateData %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(abb, -IBU.class.median), y=IBU.class.median)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust = 0.5),axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,size =   rel(.6),margin = margin(.05, unit = "cm"),vjust =0)) + 
  labs(title = "Median IBU by State", y = "Median IBU",x= 'State')

StateData %>% ggplot(aes(x=reorder(abb, -ABV.class.median), y=ABV.class.median)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") + theme(plot.title= element_text(hjust = 0.5),axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,size =   rel(.6),margin = margin(.05, unit = "cm"),vjust =0)) + 
  labs(title = "Median ABV by State", y = "Median ABV",x= 'State')
```

Question 5: Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most bitter (IBU) beer?

```{r}
max.abv <- beerbrew %>% filter(ABV==max(beerbrew$ABV,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% select(Beer_Name,ABV,Class,Style,State,Brewery_Name)
max.abv
#Answer Colorado, Lee Hill Series Vol.5, ABV = 0.128, Upslope Brewing Company

max.ibu <- beerbrew %>% filter(IBU==max(beerbrew$IBU,na.rm=TRUE)) %>% select(Beer_Name,IBU,Class,Style,State,Brewery_Name)
max.ibu
#Answer Oregon, Bitter Bitch Imperial, IBU = 138
```

Question 6: Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

```{r}
summary(beerbrew$ABV)

#Distribution of ABV Variable 
beerbrew %>% select(ABV) %>% ggplot(mapping=aes(x= ABV)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50) +  labs(title = "Distribution of Alcohol By Volume", y = "Frequency",x= 'ABV')

ggplot(beerbrew, aes(x=ABV)) + 
  geom_density()

```

Question 7: Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot.  Make your best judgment of a relationship and EXPLAIN your answer.

```{r}

lm_eqn <- function(df, y, x){
    formula = as.formula(sprintf('%s ~ %s', y, x))
    m <- lm(formula, data=df);
    # formating the values into a summary string to print out
    # ~ give some space, but equal size and comma need to be quoted
    eq <- substitute(italic(target) == a + b %.% italic(input)*","~~italic(r)^2~"="~r2*","~~p~"="~italic(pvalue), 
         list(target = y,
              input = x,
              a = format(as.vector(coef(m)[1]), digits = 2), 
              b = format(as.vector(coef(m)[2]), digits = 2), 
             r2 = format(summary(m)$r.squared, digits = 3),
             # getting the pvalue
             pvalue = format(summary(m)$coefficients[2,'Pr(>|t|)'], digits=1)
            )
          )
    as.character(as.expression(eq));                 
}

# for all beers combined, R^2=0.45
beerbrew %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV)) + geom_point() +
  geom_text(x=75,y=0.11,label=lm_eqn(beerbrew, 'ABV','IBU'),color='red',parse=T) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  labs(title="Correlation between ABV and IBU")

# for just IPA's the R^2 drops slightly to 0.41
beerbrew %>% filter(Class == "IPA") %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV)) + geom_point() +
  geom_text(x=75,y=0.03,label=lm_eqn(beerbrew %>% filter(Class == "IPA"), 'ABV','IBU'),color='red',parse=T) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  labs(title="IPA: Correlation between ABV and IBU")

#for just Ales, the R^2 drops significantly to 0.23 but is still significant with p=1e-33 Could follow up to study this by variety of Ales to see if certain styles weaken the correlation
beerbrew %>% filter(Class == "Ale") %>% ggplot(aes(x=IBU,y=ABV)) + geom_point() +
  geom_text(x=75,y=0.039,label=lm_eqn(beerbrew %>% filter(Class == "Ale"), 'ABV','IBU'),color='red',parse=T) +
  geom_smooth(method='lm') +
  labs(title="Ale: Correlation between ABV and IBU")

#overlay IPA vs. Ale on same scatterplot
beerbrew %>% filter(Class == "IPA" | Class == "Ale") %>% ggplot(mapping=aes(y=IBU, x=ABV,color=Class)) + geom_point(size=0.5, position="jitter")+ geom_smooth(method="lm",se=FALSE,size=1)+ labs(title="Correlation between ABV and IBU")

```

Question 8: Budweiser would also like to investigate the difference with respect to IBU and ABV between IPAs (India Pale Ales) and other types of Ale (any beer with “Ale” in its name other than IPA).  You decide to use KNN classification to investigate this relationship.  Provide statistical evidence one way or the other. You can of course assume your audience is comfortable with percentages … KNN is very easy to understand conceptually.

In addition, while you have decided to use KNN to investigate this relationship (KNN is required) you may also feel free to supplement your response to this question with any other methods or techniques you have learned.  Creativity and alternative solutions are always encouraged.  

```{r}

```

Question 9: Knock their socks off!  Find one other useful inference from the data that you feel Budweiser may be able to find value in.  You must convince them why it is important and back up your conviction with appropriate statistical evidence. 

```{r}

```



For instance now you can use the mapping set to plot many variables rather than recreating, like this:

```{r}


ggplot(StateMapData, aes(x=long,y=lat,group=group))+
  geom_polygon(aes(fill=ABV.class.median))+
  geom_path()+ 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours=rev(heat.colors(10)),na.value="grey90")+ggtitle("Median ABV by State")+
coord_map()
```
